	Abstract = {As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the
		  geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently
		  interpreted in the light of their genetic histories.
		  Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or
		  migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to
		  model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight
		  into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The
		  introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however,
		  offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical
		  endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for
		  inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of
		  phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping
		  in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled
		  phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral
		  dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic
		  uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended
		  with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that
		  identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion
		  process. In addition, we propose priors that can
		  incorporate geographical sampling distributions or
		  characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial
		  dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal
		  information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe
		  software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares
		  with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of
		  the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological
		  linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in
		  West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion
		  may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic
		  cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our
		  phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in
		  molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to
		  infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many
		  organisms.},

@article{Lemey:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Here, we present an analysis of the H1N1pdm genetic data sampled over the initial stages in the epidemic. To infer phylodynamic spread in time and space we employ a recently developed Bayesian statistical inference framework (Lemey et al., in press). We model spatial diffusion as a continuous-time Markov chain process along time-measured genealogies. In this analysis, we consider 40 locations for which sequence data were available on 06-Aug-2009. The sampling time interval of the 242 sequences spans from 30-Mar-2009 to 12-Jul-2009. The Bayesian inference typically results in a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees, each having an estimate of the epidemic locations at the ancestral nodes in the tree. We summarize these trees using the most representative clustering pattern and annotate these clusters with the most probable location states. We can visualize this information as tree that grows over time, seeding locations each time an ancestral node is inferred to exist at a different location. A Bayes factor test provides statistical support for epidemiological linkage throughout the evolutionary history. We demonstrate how our full probabilistic approach efficiently tracks an epidemic based on viral genetic data as it unfolds across the globe.},

@article{Trovao:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Since its first isolation in 1996 in Guangdong, China, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 has circulated in avian hosts for almost two decades and spread to more than 60 countries worldwide. The role of different avian hosts and the domestic-wild bird interface has been critical in shaping the complex HPAIV H5N1 disease ecology, but remains difficult to ascertain. To shed light on the large-scale H5N1 transmission patterns and disentangle the contributions of different avian hosts on the tempo and mode of HPAIV H5N1 dispersal, we apply Bayesian evolutionary inference techniques to comprehensive sets of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene sequences sampled between 1996 and 2011 throughout Asia and Russia. Our analyses demonstrate that the large-scale H5N1 transmission dynamics are structured according to different avian flyways, and that the incursion of the Central Asian flyway specifically was driven by Anatidae hosts coinciding with rapid rate of spread and an epidemic wavefront acceleration. This also resulted in long-distance dispersal that is likely to be explained by wild bird migration. We identify a significant degree of asymmetry in the large-scale transmission dynamics between Anatidae and Phasianidae, with the latter largely representing poultry as an evolutionary sink. A joint analysis of host dynamics and continuous spatial diffusion demonstrates that the rate of viral dispersal and host diffusivity is significantly higher for Anatidae compared with Phasianidae. These findings complement risk modeling studies and satellite tracking of wild birds in demonstrating a continental-scale structuring into areas of H5N1 persistence that are connected through migratory waterfowl.},

@article{Bostock:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a novel representation-transparent approach to visualization for the web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

	Abstract = {SUMMARY: SPREAD is a user-friendly, cross-platform
		  application to analyze and visualize Bayesian
		  phylogeographic reconstructions incorporating
		  spatial-temporal diffusion. The software maps phylogenies
		  annotated with both discrete and continuous spatial
		  information and can export high-dimensional posterior
		  summaries to keyhole markup language (KML) for animation of
		  the spatial diffusion through time in virtual globe
		  software. In addition, SPREAD implements Bayes factor
		  calculation to evaluate the support for hypotheses of
		  historical diffusion among pairs of discrete locations
		  based on Bayesian stochastic search variable selection
		  estimates. SPREAD takes advantage of multicore
		  architectures to process large joint posterior
		  distributions of phylogenies and their spatial diffusion
		  and produces visualizations as compelling and interpretable
		  statistical summaries for the different spatial
		  projections. AVAILABILITY: SPREAD is licensed under the GNU
