	Abstract = {Computational evolutionary biology, statistical
		  phylogenetics, and coalescent-based population genetics are
		  becoming increasingly central to the analysis and
		  understanding of molecular sequence data. We present the
		  Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST)
		  software package version 1.7, which implements a family of
		  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian
		  phylogenetic inference, divergence time dating, coalescent
		  analysis, phylogeography, and related molecular
		  evolutionary analyses. This package includes an enhanced
		  graphical user interface program called Bayesian
		  Evolutionary Analysis Utility (BEAUti) that enables access
		  to advanced models for molecular sequence and phenotypic
		  trait evolution that were previously available to
		  developers only. The package also provides new tools for
		  visualizing and summarizing multispecies coalescent and
		  phylogeographic analyses. BEAUti and BEAST 1.7 are open
		  source under the GNU lesser general public license and
		  available at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com and
		  http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk.},

@article{Bostock:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a novel representation-transparent approach to visualization for the web. Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

	Abstract = {SUMMARY: SPREAD is a user-friendly, cross-platform
		  application to analyze and visualize Bayesian
		  phylogeographic reconstructions incorporating
		  spatial-temporal diffusion. The software maps phylogenies
		  annotated with both discrete and continuous spatial
		  information and can export high-dimensional posterior
		  summaries to keyhole markup language (KML) for animation of
		  the spatial diffusion through time in virtual globe
		  software. In addition, SPREAD implements Bayes factor
		  calculation to evaluate the support for hypotheses of
		  historical diffusion among pairs of discrete locations
		  based on Bayesian stochastic search variable selection
		  estimates. SPREAD takes advantage of multicore
		  architectures to process large joint posterior
		  distributions of phylogenies and their spatial diffusion
		  and produces visualizations as compelling and interpretable
		  statistical summaries for the different spatial
		  projections. AVAILABILITY: SPREAD is licensed under the GNU
		  Lesser GPL and its source code is freely available as a
		  GitHub repository: https://github.com/phylogeography/SPREAD
