## PURPOSE
SpreaD3 is a program supporting processing and visualizations of Bayesian phylogeographic models.
This is the main program. Rendering engine can be found [HERE](https://github.com/phylogeography/d3-renderer)

## USAGE
SpreaD3 visualisation comprises 2-steps analysis. Parsing is done to a JSON file (data format), all the style choices are delegated to a second, renderering step, thus avoiding time consuming re-runs and facilitating different rendering possibilities. 

SpreaD3 supports KML output for viewing in [GoogleEarth](http://www.google.com/earth/) as well as in-browser, interactive display of the data, driven by [D3](https://d3js.org/) libraries.

Detailed tutorial on using SpreaD3 can be found [HERE](http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/software/SpreaD3_tutorial).
