## PURPOSE
SpreaD3 is a program supporting processing and visualizations of Bayesian phylogeographic models.

## USAGE
SpreaD3 visualisation comprises 2-steps analysis. Parsing is done to a JSON file (data format), all the style choices are delegated to a second, renderering step, thus avoiding time consuming re-runs and facilitating different rendering possibilities. 

SpreaD3 supports KML output for viewing in [GoogleEarth](www.google.com/intl/pl/earth/) as well as in-browser, interactive display of the data, driven by [D3](www.d3js.org) libraries.

Detailed tutorial on using SpreaD3 can be found [HERE](http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/software/SpreaD3_tutorial).
