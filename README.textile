h1. PURPOSE

SpreaD3 is a program supporting processing and visualizations of Bayesian phylogeographic models.

h1. USAGE

SpreaD3 visualisation comprises 2-steps analysis. Parsing is done to a JSON file (data format), all the style choices are delegated to a second, renderering step, thus avoiding time consuming re-runs and facilitating different rendering possibilities. 

SpreaD3 supports KML output for viewing in GoogleEarth [www.google.com/intl/pl/earth/] as well as in-browser, interactive display of the data, driven by D3 libraries [www.d3js.org].
