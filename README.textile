h1. PURPOSE

SPREAD 2 is a program supporting processing and visualizations of Bayesian phylogeographic models.

h1. TODO

* Renderers
  - built in renderers to KML and GeoJSON
    - control arc curvature [0 - 1]
    - color palletes for discrete traits    
    - distinction between node traits and branch traits
  - D3 renderer tool
* Two data modes. dd/mm/yyyy and old origin dates.
* Restrict visual summaries or rate statistics to a particular set of nodes, like a clade or a trunk/backbone
* Display warning if one or more of the discrete states are not found. 
* Parsers work independently (if only locations supplied then only locations will be parsed).
* Uncaught exception handler (for bug reports).
* Processing large tree distributions on GPUs. Write a small library and JNI to it.
