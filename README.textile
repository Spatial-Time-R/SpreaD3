h1. TODO

* Renderers
  - built in renderers to KML and GeoJSON
  - D3 renderer tool
  - R renderer tool
* Support for user specified traits (check the host example).
* Display warning if one or more of the discrete states are not found. 
* Two data modes. dd/mm/yyyy and old origin dates.
* Parsers work independently (if only locations supplied then only locations will be parsed).
* Uncaught exception handler (for bug reports).
* Processing large tree distributions on GPUs. For this we'd probably need to write a small library and JNI to it.  
* In circular polygons change:
